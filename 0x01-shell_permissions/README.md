# Shell Permissions Scripts

This repository contains shell scripts that demonstrate various functionalities related to permissions in Linux systems. These scripts are part of the ALX System Engineering & DevOps curriculum.

## Learning Objectives
The scripts in this repository cover the following learning objectives:

- Understanding and manipulating permissions in Linux.
- Familiarity with commands such as `chmod`, `sudo`, `su`, `chown`, and `chgrp`.
- Representation of file permissions for owner, group, and others.
- Changing permissions, owner, and group of a file.
- Running commands with root privileges.
- Creating users and groups.
- Printing real and effective user and group IDs.
- Printing the groups a user is in.
- Changing user ID or becoming superuser.

### 6-multiple_permissions
- Adds execute permission to the owner and the group owner, and read permission to other users, to the file 'hello'.

### 7-everybody
